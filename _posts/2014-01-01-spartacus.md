To idealists, he was a liberator who abolished slavery. To moviegoers and television viewers he was a sword-and-sandal icon. Marx and Lenin both praised Spartacus and he was a major figure in Soviet ideology. US President Ronald Reagan considered him a freedom fighter.  Who was Spartacus? He wasn’t a fictional character but a genuine historical figure. Spartacus led a revolt (73-71 BC) of gladiators and slaves that shocked Roman society at the time and that has echoed through the ages. Barry Strauss’s lecture will examine the man, the myth, and the legacy. According to him, the real, historical Spartacus is even more fascinating than the swashbuckling Hollywood creation.
