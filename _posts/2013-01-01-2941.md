He also became a controversial spokesman for various causes, including the anti-apartheid movement involving South Africa.  A heart attack in 1979 hastened the end of his tennis career; a second heart operation involved a blood transfusion that led to his contracting the HIV virus and, ultimately, AIDS itself. Before succumbing to the disease in 1993, he worked to educate others about HIV and AIDS.  Moreover, he wrote several books on various aspects of the African American experience, especially in sports.
