With large in-person gatherings currently prohibited on campus because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Great Lives program is offering a mini-series of videotaped lectures focusing on several notable Presidents -- an approach that seems particularly appropriate in this presidential election year.

Each lecture will be delivered by UMW Professor Emeritus of History William B. Crawley, who is the founding director of the Great Lives series. This year marks the completion of Professor Crawley’s 50 years on the Mary Washington faculty, during which he has won numerous awards for teaching excellence, focusing largely on political history.

On August 11, 2020, the first lecture on the topic of Thomas Jefferson will be posted for your enjoyment.  Additional lectures will be released every other Tuesday through October 20, 2020.  Please refer to the schedule below and click on the media link to view the lecture.
