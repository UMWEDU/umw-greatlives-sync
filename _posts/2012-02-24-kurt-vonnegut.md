<em>And So It Goes</em> is the culmination of five years of research and writing—the first-ever biography of the life of Kurt Vonnegut, author of the now-classic <em>Slaughterhouse Five</em>: Vonnegut’s World War II experiences turned into fiction.

Published in November 2011, Charles J. Shields’ biography was chosen by the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Washington Post</em> as a 2011 Notable Book, and been widely acclaimed by reviewers. Shields is also the author of <em>Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee</em> (2006), which spent 15 weeks on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list. In August 2011 he was named associate director of the Chappell Great Lives Lecture Series.
