<a href="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/01/Jim-Thorpe.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-59568 alignleft" src="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/01/Jim-Thorpe.png" alt="Jim-Thorpe" width="185" height="274" /></a> Jim Thorpe (1887-1953) was the greatest multi-sport athlete the world has ever seen – and likely to remain so as sports since his heyday have been marked by an irreversible movement to specialize. One of the best collegiate football players when the sport was in its infancy, twice an All-American, for the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The first international celebrity athlete as double gold medal winner – by huge margins – in both the pentathlon and decathlon in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics. The athlete who put the struggling sport of professional football on the map in Canton, Ohio and, in recognition of his contribution, was voted in 1920 the first president of the organization that became in 1922 the National Football League. A major league baseball player who, in 1919, playing for the Boston Braves, was the leading batter in the National League, ahead of Ty Cobb (in the American League) and Joe Jackson, until an injury took him out of the running. Born in Oklahoma as a Potawatomi and Sac &amp; Fox American Indian, Thorpe became a symbol in that highly socially stratified time of the ethnic or racial outsider who transcended such barriers by sheer excellence on the supposedly equal playing ground of sports. When he was stripped of his amateur Olympic gold medals in 1913 for being a professional – he had played minor league baseball in 1909-1911 – he became an even more potent example of the outsider humiliated and banished by an exclusionary elite. Intelligent, genial, generous, Jim Thorpe was not a complicated man, but what happened to him was.
