<a href="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/01/henry-vii.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-59615 alignleft" src="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/01/henry-vii.png" alt="henry-vii" width="173" height="296" /></a> Henry VIII was King of England from 1491, when he succeeded his father, Henry VII,   until his death in 1547.  The second monarch in the Tudor line, he is among the best-known of all English rulers. Much of the popular interest in Henry derives from his succession of six wives, including Anne Boleyn, mother of Queen Elizabeth I.  Aside from his matrimonial escapades, his popular image is dominated, on a personal level, by his enormous girth, (reportedly 54-inch waist) in his later years, and on the political level, by his role in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church.

Jeremy Black studied at Queens College Cambridge, St. Johns College Oxford, and Merton College at Oxford. He began his teaching career at the University of Durham in 1980 before moving to Exeter University in 1996, where he is the current holder of the Established Chair in History. In addition to his teaching, Professor Black has held a number of important public roles, including that of editor of <i>Archives</i>, the journal of the British Records Association. His prodigious scholarly output encompasses more than 100 publications, mainly on, but not limited to, British and continental European history, with particular emphasis on international relations and military history. He has held numerous teaching positions outside of England, having lectured extensively in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and Denmark—as well as in the US, where he has taught at the Universities of Maryland, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgetown, and Rutgers, among others. At UMW, he has delivered hugely popular Great Lives lectures on George III, Winston Churchill, and James Bond.
