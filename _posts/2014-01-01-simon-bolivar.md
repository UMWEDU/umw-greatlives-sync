Bolivar freed six countries from Spanish rule, traveling more than 75,000 miles on horseback from the Amazon Jungles to the Andes Mountains to do so. His life is the stuff of Hollywood legend: epic and heroic, he fought battle after battle in punishing terrain, forged uncertain coalitions of competing forces and races, lost his beautiful wife soon after they married (and never remarried), and died relatively young. Marie Arana will examine Bolivar’s dramatic and many-faceted life: fearless general, brilliant strategist, the consulate diplomat, passionate abolitionist, gifted writer, and flawed politician.
