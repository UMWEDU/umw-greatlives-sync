Liz Humes is an artist, writer, radio host, activist and mother. But mostly she just likes to "read, think about ideas and listen to cool people talk." She has read a book a week since February 2005, when the first version of Wordy Birds debuted on WRIR 97.3 FM, which is now broadcast every Friday at noon from Richmond, Virginia.

All Wordy Birds interviews are conducted face-to-face with the authors. To listen outside of the Richmond metro area, the show is streamed live on <a href="http://www.wrir.org./" target="_blank">www.wrir.org.</a>

Liz is currently the President of the board of WRIR-LP FM. Prior to her involvement with Richmond Independent Radio, Liz was the publisher of <em>Punchline</em>, a free alternative weekly in Richmond. She has also worked with local and national publications including <em>Vegetarian Times</em>, the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em>, <em>Style Weekly</em> and the Greater Richmond Partnership <em>Viewbook</em>.
