Vice-president of the United States, brilliant attorney, duelist, and renegade leader of Western adventurers— Aaron Burr cut a path through American history that is bold, at times erratic, and highly controversial. In his fast-paced book, <em>American Emperor: Aaron Burr’s Challenge to Jefferson’s America</em>, historian and constitutional lawyer David O. Stewart follows close on the trail of Burr during the most exciting period of his career.
