<h4>High-definition presentations of all 2012 lectures in the Chappell Great Lives series are available for viewing online under “Archived Lectures” on the homepage of the Chappell Great Lives Lecture Series.</h4>
The videos are released five weeks after the live presentation. Each presentation is full-length, about an hour, and begins with a short introduction summarizing the life of person written about, followed by background about the lecturer. The release dates will run into the end June, the last being James “Bud” Robertson’s lecture on the Civil War soldier. After that, several years’ worth of lectures will be available, as well.

Also, the lectures are available on iTunes U, as well.
