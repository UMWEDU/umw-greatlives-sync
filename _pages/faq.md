<h2>What time do the Great Lives 2021 Zoom lectures start?</h2>
Viewers may join the zoom lecture at 7:15 p.m. on Tuesday and Thursday evenings to view a slideshow about our 2021 season.  At 7:30 p.m., the pre-recorded lecture will begin.  lectures are approximately 50 minutes long and are followed by an audience question and answer segment with our audience.

<h2>What constitutes a “Great” life?</h2>
It is perhaps the most common misconception that “great” equates to “good” or “admirable” in selecting subjects for the Series. The key criteria is not virtue, but rather influence on history or culture in a significant way—for good or (sometimes) ill. (This explains why the Series has occasionally included some fictional characters.)
<h2>How are subjects chosen?</h2>
A number of factors are taken into account. The guiding principle is diversity of subject matter—not just in terms of race or gender, but other areas of diversity as well, particularly fields of accomplishment. Thus topics include persons who have gained significant recognition in the areas of politics, military, literature, science, visual arts, music, theatre, sports, and popular culture. An effort is also made to incorporate lectures by the most recent scholars on various topics. As a rule, subjects are not repeated unless considerable time has elapsed between lectures or the second lecture involves a new and/or controversial approach to the topic.
