Juliette Gordon Low spent several years searching for something useful to do with her life. Her search ended in 1911, when she met retired British officer Sir Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides. On returning to the United States in 1912, she called her cousin. “Come right over! I've got something for the girls of Savannah, and all of America, and all the world, and we're going to start it tonight!” Within ten years, the Girl Scouts organization was indeed worldwide. Stacey Cordery’s biography of Juliette Gordon Low is the first of its kind. An historian teaching at Monmouth College in Illinois, she is also the author of <em>Alice Roosevelt Longworth, from White House Princess to Washington Power Broker.</em>
