<a href="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/01/Beecher-200x300.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-59590 alignleft" src="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/01/Beecher-200x300-200x300.png" alt="Beecher-200x300" width="200" height="300" /></a> No one predicted success for Henry Ward Beecher at his birth in 1813.  The boisterous son of the last great Puritan minister, he seemed destined to be overshadowed by his brilliant siblings – especially his sister, Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of the classic best-selling novel <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>. But Beecher found international fame by shedding his father’s fire-and-brimstone theology and instead preaching a gospel of unconditional love and healing, becoming one of the founding fathers of modern American Christianity.  He became what might be called “the Forest Gump” of the 19th Century, throwing himself into many of the era’s greatest events. He championed controversial causes like abolitionism, Darwinism, and women’s rights, and his church was one of the country’s first mega-churches and New York’s top tourist site. He was famous for his spectacular stunts, like auctioning beautiful light-skinned slave girls to freedom from his church pulpit. Then, at the peak of his fame, Beecher was accused of seducing his female parishioners, creating a sex scandal that garnered more newspaper headlines than the entire Civil War.  In our own time, when religion and politics are again colliding and adultery in high places still commands headlines, Beecher’s story sheds new light on America’s culture and conflicts.
