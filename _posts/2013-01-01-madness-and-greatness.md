<a href="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2012/11/First-Rate-Madness.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-47581 alignleft" src="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2012/11/First-Rate-Madness-204x300.jpg" alt="First Rate Madness" width="204" height="300" /></a> According to Dr. Ghaemi, “Most of our heroes are seen as superheroes.  We don’t really know the human beings who were Lincoln and Churchill and King and Gandhi, or even Hitler. They are icons, or devils.” In this lecture, he will examine who they were psychologically, focusing on their moods: did they have depression or bipolar illness?  He will show evidence for such mood diseases or traits in their lives, and how those moods actually helped them in their abilities as crisis leaders, or how they sometimes harmed them, especially in non-crisis periods.  He will argue that many of their greatest strengths grew out of their weaknesses and that depression and manic symptoms can have positive aspects – that, indeed, those positive aspects are beneficial for crisis leadership.
