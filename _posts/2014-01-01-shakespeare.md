<a href="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/01/shakespeare.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-59608 alignleft" src="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/01/shakespeare-205x300.png" alt="shakespeare" width="205" height="300" /></a> William Shakespeare is the best known writer in the world, and the one about whom we know least of what we really want to know. His achievements are easier to feel than to describe, and his life and works often seem to bear little relation to each other. This lecture will suggest some new connections between the two. Its focus will be primarily on the dramatist as a professional whose acting and writing career was the most important part of his life. It will also draw on the increasing awareness of the possible role of collaboration in Shakespeare’s work and the diversity of the audiences for which he was writing.
