<strong>2019 Series Parking
</strong>January 3rd, 2019

As we  kick off the 2019 Great Lives series, we'd like to remind guests of available parking on campus:
<ul>
 	<li>The parking lot for George Washington Hall (number 22 on the map) and all guest spaces along Double Drive are available for guests. A handful of spaces along Double Drive will be reserved for the speaker and sponsors or guests each evening.</li>
 	<li><strong>ALL </strong>faculty and staff spaces are available for guest parking <strong>beginning at 5:00 PM</strong>. Faculty and staff lots are identified on the map with a dark blue box and parking symbol.</li>
 	<li>Residential streets adjacent to campus, including College Avenue and residential streets <strong>open for community parking at 7:00 PM</strong> on weekdays.</li>
 	<li>The UMW parking deck (number 40 on the map) is available, but a far walk from George Washington Hall</li>
 	<li>Guests should be prepared for possible uneven surfaces as they walk. Consider using a small flashlight or the flashlight function on a cell phone as a guide.</li>
</ul>
