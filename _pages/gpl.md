<span style="font-weight: 400">Welcome to the 2021 season of Great Lives: Biographical Approaches to History and Culture!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Because of restrictions on public gatherings on campus, the entire series of 18 lectures will be pre-recorded and delivered electronically, through Zoom Webinars, with closed captioning available.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although the presentations will be taped in advance, there will still be a live Q&amp;A session following the online debut of each lecture, in which the speaker will be available to answer questions submitted by audience members. </span>

Zoom webinars open at 7:15 p.m. and the lectures begin at 7:30 p.m.

<em>Zoom links can be found on the lecture pages below! </em>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Procedure: During the webinar, audience members’ cameras will be off and microphones will be muted. In order to ask a question, viewers may use the Q &amp; A tab at the bottom of the screen to type questions at any point during the lecture. At the end of the presentation, questions will be relayed to the speaker by the moderator.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">It is important to note that, even though the lectures will be archived and available on our website subsequent to their original offering, it will be possible to interact with the speakers ONLY on the dates of the original presentations. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">We invite you to join us for what promises to be a most interesting and entertaining series of presentations!</span>
