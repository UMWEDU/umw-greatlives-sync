<a href="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2012/11/Sound-of-Freedom.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-47621 alignleft" src="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2012/11/Sound-of-Freedom-185x300.jpg" alt="Sound of Freedom" width="134" height="217" /></a> In 1939 Marian Anderson was at the peak of her career as an opera singer, yet she was denied the opportunity to present a concert at the DAR’s Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C.—not because of anything she had done, but because she was black. That incident resulted in a nationwide protest, led by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. The concert was eventually moved to the Lincoln Memorial, where Ms. Anderson attracted a throng of 75,000 people to what became an electrifying moment (and sometimes overlooked milestone) in civil rights history. The focus of this lecture will be the significance of that concert and the life of the musical pioneer who has been likened to a female Jackie Robinson for her brave and path-breaking career.
