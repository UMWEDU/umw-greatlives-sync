<a href="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/01/Mata-Hari.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-59576 alignleft" src="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/01/Mata-Hari.png" alt="Mata-Hari" width="148" height="225" /></a> In the early years of the twentieth century, Mata Hari was known as the most desirable woman in Europe, an artistic and utterly novel dancer who brought sacred temple dances from Asia to the European public. She was the woman every man wanted on his arm — glamorous, beautiful, cultured and sensual — and was seen with most of the wealthy and powerful men of Europe and performed in sold-out theatres everywhere in Western Europe. Despite her fame and adoration, she was arrested and shot in 1917 as a spy for Germany (and against France) in World War I. After 6 months of constant surveillance, opening her mail, reading her telegrams, listening in on her phone calls, and questioning nearly everyone she dealt with in any way, the prosecution could not produce a single document or secret she had passed to the Germans, nor any evidence of clandestine contact with the enemy. The main witness against her was the man who had recruited her to spy for France. Was she executed as a scapegoat to explain why the war was going badly? Or was she condemned for being an openly sexual, single woman who lived an extravagant life in time of war?
