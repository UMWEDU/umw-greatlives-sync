Based on the latest guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Virginia Department of Health, the University will immediately initiate a series of steps designed to mitigate the risk of transmission. The goal of these efforts is to promote social distancing by minimizing gatherings in which members of the community spend long periods of time in close proximity. We know from public health officials that this step is essential to help slow the spread of the virus in the United States.

All classes and public activities are suspended at the University.  Great Lives lectures have been cancelled through April 6.  The University will continue to monitor the situation and will re-assess and determine if the two remaining lectures scheduled for April 7 and April 14 will proceed.

The University will remain open with operations and services continuing with minimal interruptions. Questions about the Great Lives Series may be directed to Ali Hieber via email: <a href="mailto:agauch@umw.edu">agauch@umw.edu</a>  or by phone at (540)654-1276.

<strong>COVID-19 Update:  March 10, 2020</strong>

As we absorb news about the global outbreak of coronavirus, or COVID-19, we all are experiencing heightened anxiety. Rest assured the University’s Emergency Operations Team is closely monitoring the situation, conferring with other universities, and following guidance from the CDC and the Virginia Department of Health. At this time, we have <strong>no</strong> confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the campus community. As you know, things are fluid and can quickly change. As of now, we will continue with our Great Lives schedule in Dodd Auditorium; however, I would advise you to pay close attention to coronavirus updates on the UMW home page (umw.edu).

<strong>Great Lives Raised Over $14,000 on #MaryWashDay</strong>

April 8th, 2019

The University of Mary Washington met its goal of 3,500 gifts on Giving Day, March 19th, all thanks to our generous donors.

Great Lives raised a total of $14,311, far surpassing our expectations. We are incredibly lucky to have such dedicated patrons, whose generosity continues to make Pulitzer Prize winning authors and noted historians available to the Fredericksburg community.

From the team at Great Lives: A sincere thank you for all you do to support the series!

<strong>2019 Series Parking
</strong>January 3rd, 2019

As we kick off the 2019 Great Lives series, we'd like to remind guests of the parking regulations on campus and highlight new City of Fredericksburg parking regulations in the surrounding community:
<ul>
 	<li>The parking lot for George Washington Hall (number 22 on the map) and spaces along Double Drive are available for guests. A handful of spaces along outbound Double Drive will be reserved for the speaker, sponsor and busses.</li>
 	<li><strong>ALL </strong>faculty and staff spaces are available for guest parking <strong>beginning at 5:00 PM</strong>. Faculty and staff lots are identified on the map with a dark blue box and parking symbol.</li>
 	<li>Residential streets adjacent to campus, including College Avenue are now <strong>open for community parking beginning at 7:00 PM</strong> on weekdays.</li>
 	<li>Visitor  parking in the UMW parking deck (number 40 on the map) is available, but prepare for a significant walk  to reach George Washington Hall.</li>
 	<li>Guests should be prepared for possible uneven surfaces as they walk from parking to the auditorium. Consider using a small flashlight or the flashlight function on a cell phone as a guide.</li>
</ul>
