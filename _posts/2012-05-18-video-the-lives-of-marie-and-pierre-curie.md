Lauren Redniss is a graphic biographer whose writing and drawing have appeared in the <em>New York Times</em>, which nominated her for the Pulitzer Prize. Her idea for a life of the Curies occurred to her because, she told the online magazine, <em>Intelligent Life</em>, “I had been thinking about love stories….What struck me as an interesting challenge was that the two main themes were love and radioactivity. And both of those things, of course, are invisible. I loved the idea that I could try to make a visual book out of invisible things.” <em>Radioactive: Marie &amp; Pierre Curie</em> was a finalist for the National Book Award.  Redniss teaches at Parsons the New School for Design in New York City.

In this presentation at the National Book Awards ceremony, Ms. Redniss summarizes her approach to creating the Curie book. (She did not wish her Great Lives presentation to be made available.)
