<a href="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/01/Hatfields.png"><img class="  wp-image-59603 alignleft" src="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/greatlives/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/01/Hatfields-194x300.png" alt="Hatfields" width="147" height="228" /></a> Although the word “feud” instantly brings to almost any American mind the Hatfields and McCoys, few people actually know much about the legendary blood feud.  Dean King has pursued the subject in great detail and at personal peril, having been shot at in the wilds of Appalachia in the course of his research.  In the process, he notes that he “rode on ATVs with the Hatfields up onto the ridges where they once hid out and explored the ‘angry gene’ with the McCoys.”  In his talk he will, in his words, “show images, old and new, from both sides….The story busts some of the legends of yore but—as we all know—sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction.”
