Dear Friends,

<strong>As will happen from time-to-time, technology let us down</strong>. After filming author Harriet Reisen's presentation on Louisa May Alcott, we discovered that the digital file was corrupt, unusable. This is a loss, of course. Fortunately, she gave a similar talk on C-SPAN2's BookTV in 2009 and you can watch it <a title="Harriet Reisen's talk on BookTV" href="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/290338-1" target="_blank">here.</a>

In place of Ms. Reisen's presentation in Dodd Auditorium on March 13, we offer this special talk about the first modern biography, Boswell's <em>Life of Johnson</em> with books and materials from University of Mary Washington Simpson Library Special Collections. We use music, portraits, pages from books hundreds of years old, and a narrative to tell the story of how James Boswell met and befriended the large, gruff Samuel "Dictionary" Johnson and later wrote a biography of him that became a classic.

This presentation was a collaborative effort among Simpson Special Collections librarian Carolyn Parsons; Tim Owens, Instructional Technology Specialist in the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies; library student intern, Stephanie Hall; and Charles J. Shields, Associate Director, Chappell Great Lives Lecture Series.
