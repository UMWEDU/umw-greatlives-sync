P. Morgan, and John D. Rockefeller.  Born within a few years of one another during the 1830s, six decades later they dominated the American industrial economy as no small group had ever done before or would do again. Though conservative politically, they were revolutionaries in the most profound sense, for they overturned old orders and utterly changed how millions of people lived their lives.
